        <p>Meditation is the act of training attention and awareness to 
            achive a mentally clear and emotionally calm state of mind</p>
            
            <p>Meditation can trace its roots back over 5,000 years to India,
                 where wall art has been found depicting figures in the meditative position.
            </p>

            <p>Meditation has long been a spritual practice in hinduism but in later centuries new forms were developed 
                in other parts of Asia which were incorperated into other spiritual cultures such as Buddisim.
            </p>

            <p>In modern times meditation as grown into a global movement, practiced by
                 people from all walks of life, cultures, races and nationalitys. Meditation shows 
                 no signs of slowing down as the mental heath becomes an ever present 
                issue in the modern world and the benefits of meditation are undoubtable.

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Here we'll look in more depth at the benefits of practicing meditation.</p>
        <h3>Mental Health</h3>
        <p>Frequent practice of meditation has been shown to increase focus, relive stress and help 
            ease depression. Meditation can also give you a sense of stability in everyday life as 
            it provides a stress and noise free part of your day that will help with allowing the brain to process
            what is going on in your life.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical</h3>
        <p>
            The key here is stress control, high stress level can increase blood pressure, increase your heart
             rate and oxygen consumption. By introducing medditation into your life these issues can be tamed 
             which can lower your chances of developing heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
        </p>
        <h3>Emotional</h3>
        <p>
            Brain power, involving medditation into your life can boost brain power and help you deal 
            with stressful situation when they arise. As you become more experienced you will train your mind 
            to be calm when the need arises, enabling you to focus and navagate your way through situations 
            with better clarity.
